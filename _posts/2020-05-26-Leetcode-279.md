**Prompt:** Given an integer **n**, return the least number of *perfect squares* that sum up to **n**.

Note: A *perfect square* is an integer that is a square of an integer.  For example, 1, 4, 9, and 16 are perfect squares while 3 and 11 are not.

Example: 
~~~
Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
~~~

~~~
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
~~~

**Solution:** We can solve this with bottom up tubularization. The base case of the DP problem is when **i = 1**. The target state of the DP problem is **i = n**. For each state, if **i** is a perfect square, the number of perfect squares that sum up to **i** is 1. However, if **i** is not a perfect square, we can loop through all previous perfect squares, **j**, and calculate the number of perfect squares as the minimum of **1 + dp[i-j]**.
