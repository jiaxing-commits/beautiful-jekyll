The **Ginger Garlic Green Onion Sauce (3G Sauce)** is a really good pairing with poached chicken. The sauce itself is really heavy in flavor. Hence, it's a good complementary component to food that taste *bland*, like poached chicken. Other foods that might go well with the 3G Sauce would be boiled eggs, plain white rice, pasta, and etc. 

**Ingredients:**
* 1/2 or a whole ginger
* 2 or 3 cloves of garlic
* 3 green onions
* neutral oil (any oil listed below)
    * Corn oil
    * Canola Oil 
    * Vegetable Oil
* 1/2 table spoon of fine salt

**Note:** The amount of ingredients varies on how much you're serving. 

**Instructions:**
1. Shave off the skin from the ginger using a spoon or knife
2. Discard the skin and cut off the stem from the cloves of garlic
3. Mince the ginger, cloves of garlic, and green onions into a paste. 
    * The paste can be a little chunky.
4. Place the paste into a bowl
5. Estimate the amount of oil that takes to slightly submerge the paste in a bowl and pour it into another bowl
6. Pour the bowl of oil into a pan and heat it up until it smokes a little bit
7. **Slowly and Carefully** pour the oil on the paste. 
    * As a precaution, it will sizzle and maybe have tiny splashes

That's it! Your 3G Sauce is ready to go!
