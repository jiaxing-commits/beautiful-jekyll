**Prompt:** An ugly number is a positive integer that is divisible by **a**, **b**, or **c**. Given four integers **n**, **a**, **b**, and **c**, return the **nth** ugly number.

Example:

~~~
Input: n = 3, a = 2, b = 3, c = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10... The 3rd is 4.
~~~
~~~
Input: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12... The 4th is 6.
~~~
~~~
Input: n = 5, a = 2, b = 11, c = 13
Output: 10
Explanation: The ugly numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13... The 5th is 10.
~~~
~~~
Input: n = 1000000000, a = 2, b = 217983653, c = 336916467
Output: 1999999984
~~~

**Solution:** We can do a binary search to find the nth ugly number within the range of 1 to 2 * 10<sup>9</sup>. We can find the number of multiples in a certain number by using the before code snippet:

{% highlight python linenos %}
def lcm(x, y):
    return  x * y  // gcd(x,y)        
        
def total_num_of_multiples(number):
    ab = lcm(a,b)
    bc = lcm(b,c)
    ac = lcm(a,c)

    abc = lcm(a, bc)

    result = number // a + number // b + number // c 
    result -= number // ab + number // bc + number // ac
    result += number // abc

    return result  
{% endhighlight %}

The runtime for this solution is **O(log n)**.
