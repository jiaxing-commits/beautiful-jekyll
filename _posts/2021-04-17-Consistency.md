To be decency good in any task, `consistency` is the key. Often, I tried to focus on many things and fail to continue them. For example, I have tried many goals such as leet coding, working out, editing, startups, and many other habits that I've tried to pick up.

I have failed to stay consistent in many of my tasks because I had too much on my hands. Naturally, __it is hard to learn and consistently do more than 3 tasks at the same time__. This is exponentially harder when I do not receive the results that I believe that I should receive in a short timeframe. This leads me to think that I should:
1. Divide my focus into no more than 3 hobbies
2. Set realistic short-term goals/achievements
