**Prompt:** Given a list of **n** numbers, a peak element is an element where itâ€™s greater than its neighbors. Find the peak element within **O(log n)** time. _It can be assumed that the **n + 1** th element is negative infinity._

Example: 

~~~
nums = [1,2,3,1]
3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
~~~
~~~
nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
~~~


**Solution:** This is a simple binary search where the search target is greater than both of its neighbors.
