**Prompt:** Given two strings *s1* and *s2*, return true if *s2* contains the permutation of *s1*. In other words, one of *s1*'s permutations is the substring of *s2*.

Example:
~~~
Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output: true
Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").
~~~
~~~
Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"
Output: false
~~~

**Solution:** The solution for this problem is a sliding window. The condition for the sliding window is that it should be the length of string *s1* and all characters in the sliding window should have the same frequency of all the characters in *s1*. The runtime is **O(n)**.
