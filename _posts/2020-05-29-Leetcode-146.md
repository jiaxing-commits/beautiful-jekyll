**Prompt:** Implement a data structure that follows the constraints as Least Recently Used (LRU) Cache implementation. 

Example:

~~~
Input: 
["LRUCache", "put", "put", "get", "put", "get", "put", "get", "get", "get"]
[[2], [1, 1], [2, 2], [1], [3, 3], [2], [4, 4], [1], [3], [4]]
Output
[null, null, null, 1, null, -1, null, -1, 3, 4]

Explanation: 
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {4=4, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4
~~~

**Solution:** The LRU policy can easily be implemented with the ordered dictionary on pythonâ€™s library. We can treat the ordered dictionary as the cache. For the get function, we can just pop the key and value from the cache and reinsert the key and value into the dictionary so that it is recently used. For the put function, we can just insert the key and value into the dictionary if the key does not exist. If the key exists already, the key and value needs to be popped out first.
