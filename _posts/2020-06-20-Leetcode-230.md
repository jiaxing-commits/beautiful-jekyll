**Prompt:** Given the root of a binary search tree, and an integer **k**, return the ***k*th** (1-indexed) smallest element in the tree.

~~~
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1
~~~
~~~
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3
~~~

**Solution:** We can recursively traverse the binary tree on all left subtree and then right subtree. At each node, we can return the ordered list in the form of left subtree result + current node value + right subtree result. At the end of the traversal, we will have a list that is ordered and we can just index into the list. The runtime for this solution is **O(log n)** since we can stop traversing to the right subtrees once we have at least **k** number of elements in the list.
