**Prompt:** Given an m x n 2D array that represents a map. Each value has either “1” or “0” where it represents land or water, respectively. 

**Goal:** Find how many islands there are. 

{: .box-note}
**Note:** An island is all adjacently vertically or horizontally connected lands.
 

Examples:

~~~
1 0 1 
0 1 0 
1 0 1

There are 5 islands.
~~~  
<br/>
~~~
1 1 1
0 0 0 
1 0 0 

There are 2 islands
~~~
<br/>
~~~
1 0 1
1 1 1 
1 0 1

There is 1 island.
~~~
<br/>
~~~
1 0 1
1 1 0 
1 0 1

There are 3 islands.
~~~

**Solution:** One island can be represented by one piece of the land. Then, we can just invalidate all other pieces of the island to avoid recounting the same island. This is a search problem to search and invalidate all other pieces of the same island when there is an island founded. 

Example: 
~~~
1 1 1
0 0 0 
1 0 0 

1 island is found in indices (0,0) 
We need to invalidate all its other pieces
~~~
<br/>
~~~
1 x x
0 0 0 
1 0 0 

We can use DFS to search for all other pieces of the first island. Then, we can invalidate the pieces by replacing the 1's with x's
~~~
<br/>
~~~
1 x x
0 0 0 
1 0 0

2 islands are found
