**Prompt:** Given a string **s**, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example:

~~~
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
~~~
~~~
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
~~~
~~~
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
~~~
~~~
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
~~~

**Solution:** We can use a nested for loop to loop to the right and again to the left to find all substrings. When we find a substring, we check if there is a duplicate character. If there is, discard it. If thereâ€™s none, then we can compare the length of the substring with the current longest length of a substring without duplicates. The runtime for this solution is **O(n<sup>2</sup>)**
