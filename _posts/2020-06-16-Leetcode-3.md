**Prompt:** Given a string **s**, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example:

~~~
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
~~~
~~~
Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
~~~
~~~
Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
~~~
~~~
Input: s = ""
Output: 0
~~~

**Solution:** This is a sliding windows problem. We can solve it with a sliding window where the sliding window has no repeating characters. The runtime of this solution is **O(n)**
