**Prompt:** Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of s such that the frequency of each character in this substring is greater than or equal to k.

Example:
~~~
Input: s = "aaabb", k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest substring is "aaa", as 'a' is repeated 3 times.
~~~
~~~
Input: s = "ababbc", k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substring is "ababb", as 'a' is repeated 2 times and 'b' is repeated 3 times.
~~~

**Solution:** We can solve this with a sliding windows solution. The sliding window will have a condition that only a certain number of unique characters can be in it and all the unique characters must have the frequency of *k* or more. The runtime of this algorithm is **O(m x n)** where *m* is the number of unique characters in string *s* and *n* is the length of string *s*.
