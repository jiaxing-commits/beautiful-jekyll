**Prompt:** You are given two strings *s* and *t* of the same length. You want to change *s* to *t*. Changing the **i-th** character of *s* to **i-th** character of *t* costs abs(s[i] - t[i]) that is, the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters.

You are also given an integer maxCost.

Return the maximum length of a substring of *s* that can be changed to be the same as the corresponding substring of *t* with a cost less than or equal to maxCost.

If there is no substring from *s* that can be changed to its corresponding substring from *t*, return 0.

Example:
~~~
Input: s = "abcd", t = "bcdf", maxCost = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: "abc" of s can change to "bcd". That costs 3, so the maximum length is 3.
~~~
~~~
Input: s = "abcd", t = "cdef", maxCost = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: Each character in s costs 2 to change to charactor in t, so the maximum length is 1.
~~~
~~~
Input: s = "abcd", t = "acde", maxCost = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: You can't make any change, so the maximum length is 1.
~~~

**Solution:** We can solve this with a sliding window. The sliding window has a condition where the cost of the current substring in the sliding window is less than the max cost. The runtime of this solution is **O(n)**.
