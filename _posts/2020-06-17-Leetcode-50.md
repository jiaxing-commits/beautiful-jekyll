**Prompt:** Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., x<sup>n</sup>).

Example:
~~~
Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000
~~~
~~~
Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100
~~~
~~~
Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25
~~~

**Solution:** First, we have to think of examples of the problem like so:

If b is even:  
a<sup>b</sup> = a<sup>(b/2)</sup> * a<sup>(b/2)</sup>  
a<sup>b</sup> = (a<sup>b/2</sup>)<sup>2</sup>

If b is odd:  
a<sup>b</sup> = a<sup>(b/2)</sup> * a<sup>(b/2)</sup> * a  
a<sup>b</sup> = (a<sup>b/2</sup>)<sup>2</sup> * a

Then, we can solve this with either a recursion method or iterative method. The base case for this solution would be a<sup>0</sup> = 1 because b keeps dividing by 2. The runtime would be **O(log n)** because b keeps dividing by 2 until 0. We want to use the iterative method since iterative programs are faster than recursive ones.
